# ML-Project
This project trains and tests data from a solubility dataset. 

1. Loads dataset and separates the features (X) and target variable (logS).
2. Splits the data into training and testing sets.
3. Builds and evaluates two regression models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.
4. Compares the performance of the models using metrics like MSE and R-squared.
5. Visualizes the prediction results of the Linear Regression model on the training data.
